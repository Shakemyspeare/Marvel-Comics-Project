# Marvel-Comics-Project
Python Live Project

My Marvel Comics Character Database website. 

Using the Django Framework I created a website that allows users to not only search for their favorite Marvel Comics characters, but also gives them to opportunity to find characters that they have never heard of.

With officail Marvel Comics API and webscrapping, this website let users find the specific comics of their favorite characters and keep up on the lastest Marvel Comics news.
